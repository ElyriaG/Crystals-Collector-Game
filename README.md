# unit-4-game

This project shows my knowledge of javascript and jQuery by way of a game, as well as HTML and CSS. 

The game shows 4 images whose values are hidden to the user. They must click the images to add up their score to  match the goal number. If they match, they win a point. If they go over, their lose score goes up by one. The game ends when either the win or lose points equal to ten.
