This app was created to test my knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery by way of a game. 

The game shows 4 crystal images whose values are hidden to the user. They must click the images to add up their score to  match the goal number. If they match, they win a point. If they go over, the losses score goes up by one. The game ends when either the wins or losses points equal to ten.
